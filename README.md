# Machine Learning Project to Predict How a Student's Study Hours affect Academic Performance
## Task 5: Prediction using Supervised ML
Steps:

Used Pandas libary to fetch the data as a DataFrame
Split the DataFrame data into features and labels
Split the data into training and test data using sklearn's train_test_split function
Created the first model, tested results using test data and visualized the results
Repeated the procedure until the loss decreases significantly while tweaking hyperparameters to optimize model performance
Used the final model to predict the result of a student studying for 9.25 hours.
